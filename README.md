# DSA_PROJECT
This project is a Secure Autocomplete System developed in Python that combines data structures, encryption, and an interactive terminal UI. The main objective is to implement a fast autocomplete engine using the Trie data structure while ensuring that the stored words remain private through RSA encryption.
